## What is STEMist?

STEMist is a 501(c)3 nonprofit based at Lynbrook High School.

In addition to teaching classes, it also supports STEM education in many other ways such as hosting a Youtube channel and organizing a hackathon. Over the summer of 2022, STEMist raised over $1,200 for charity and taught over 30 hour-long classes.
